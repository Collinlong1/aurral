# Fork feature inventory — Phase 0.5 execution record

**Status: all 16 preservation branches published and independently validated. No PRs opened. Phase 1 not started.**

Matching upstream base: `7afcb7cb23274a9ec92d0b57feb6a088c5ae64ef`. Unchanged fork main: `aa643d316e9e00fb8622ab60b2fb2cb8b76661ee`. Unchanged plugin main: `506e5259e1442b8cfe072a75b129abb428c6bcf7`. The refresh added an upstream-only merge to fork history: **109 fork-only historical commits; 52 net changed paths, +3,130/−181 lines**. All issue branches have exactly one new commit with the matching upstream SHA as their sole parent.

[Current matching-base comparison](https://github.com/lklynet/aurral/compare/7afcb7cb23274a9ec92d0b57feb6a088c5ae64ef...Collinlong1:aa643d316e9e00fb8622ab60b2fb2cb8b76661ee). Later observed upstream main `656475b92be36b6834002da2407e7d9d50c2e0c2` is one commit beyond the matching base; no automatic rebase or main sync was performed.

User approval covers Phase 0.5 and reuse of the already-created classical branches. Upstream is read-only; all new issue branches are in Collinlong1/aurral. Existing fork classical is reused and advanced only through the already-existing fork-main ancestry, followed by handoff documentation. Plugin classical receives documentation only. Neither main is modified.

Workflow-only F01 passed actionlint; no runtime source changed. `PHASE_05_VALIDATION.json` records exact commands/results.

## Independence, adaptations and actual files

### F01 — Optional container image publishing

The old workflow was explicitly fork-only. The preserved branch uses generic repository identity and explicit ENABLE_CONTAINER_PUBLISHING opt-in, with feature/** support. It stays disabled; its actual GitHub run was skipped. Original main workflow is unchanged.

Original commit provenance: `11739f0945e388bfc40f88de30cb1c6538dcf7fa`, `34d17c9cd8eeacb5d63a17a949090d649f0f7698`, `34bbedba1f07307bf24d182acde91387454582c4`.

Actual isolated files:

- `.github/workflows/fork-image.yml`
- `docs/src/content/docs/admin/optional-container-publishing.mdx`

Status: independently validated; owner review pending; no PR submitted. Base and actual commit are in the table above.

### F02 — Missing-track download indicator scope

Only missing-track indicator helpers/hooks/actions and their test; no pagination code.

Original commit provenance: `cd409bad9c0fa14a950c6e1cb0dbab3188a58e26`.

Actual isolated files:

- `.tests/frontend/active-downloads.test.ts`

- `frontend/src/utils/activeDownloads.ts`

Status: independently validated; owner review pending; no PR submitted. Base and actual commit are in the table above.

### F03 — Numbered Library pages and item range

Removed page-size selector from numbered navigation; uses stock page size. No URL/query-size changes. Existing pagination CSS relocation is accounted for here.

Original commit provenance: `2d8e625fc99536f84be34a269e4244ab4b96a299`, `ff1d308b5bbd3d3ca3c12193f16a6f98d0209b3a`, `cfa5fe26c6a7e4c1ffb37d6190294b6c74bcb122`, `3bdb4e702d1e1befc4330b5f910e41b72f0d808f`.

- `frontend/src/utils/pagination.ts`

Status: independently validated; owner review pending; no PR submitted. Base and actual commit are in the table above.

### F04 — Selectable Library page size

Page-size selection uses upstream previous/next navigation, not F03 component. Retains URL/query/prefetch behavior and pageSizeParams test.

Original commit provenance: `ff1d308b5bbd3d3ca3c12193f16a6f98d0209b3a`, `3bdb4e702d1e1befc4330b5f910e41b72f0d808f`.

Status: independently validated; owner review pending; no PR submitted. Base and actual commit are in the table above.

### F08 — Resolve a missing track using an existing Library file

Local eligibility predicate removes dependency on F06. Library-only picker, route and owner-command adapter work without disk import. Typed query-cache update avoids inherited unsafe-any problem. Added saved/cancelled versus cancelled-album regression.

Original commit provenance: `79b9bef44762ff79152630f84c1592938de25f42`, `0ef5061d0c29750ccb5f1b88574e73e87047403a`.

Status: independently validated; owner review pending; no PR submitted. Base and actual commit are in the table above.

### F09 — Resolve a missing track using a copied disk file

Independent admin disk-import picker and localized eligibility predicate remove F08/F06 dependencies. Uses only import routes/command adapter. Copies nearby art without requiring F10 artwork rendering; typed cache update included.

Original commit provenance: `1c68fc63c9858ee9505013ca27ff9cf462755984`, `aa7f72a7f299afaced069431b4e4de4332064e8c`.

Status: independently validated; owner review pending; no PR submitted. Base and actual commit are in the table above.

### F10 — Local album artwork fallback for playlist rows

Only artwork lookup/rendering. Test seeds an ordinary completed native job directly rather than using link/import endpoints. Performance budget test passed unchanged.

Original commit provenance: `aa7f72a7f299afaced069431b4e4de4332064e8c`, `58667789c3d2d14e89c898355579e66a4a79d0a5`, `37b670eb6142301541cd4948e14b726af57ce991`.

Status: independently validated; owner review pending; no PR submitted. Base and actual commit are in the table above.

### F11 — Playlist rows follow current indexed track names

Only current Library metadata lookup/rendering, with an independent LibraryJob type. Native completed-job fixture avoids link/import dependencies. Performance budget test passed unchanged.

Original commit provenance: `eedfb2efd628c5a73ce5afc06e693aa02b80a0bc`.

Status: independently validated; owner review pending; no PR submitted. Base and actual commit are in the table above.

### F12 — Resolve Subsonic playlist songs by linked file path

Only file-path identity and favourite/star mapping. No rescan timestamp or removed artist-source feature. Measured playlist query count is 130 cold/50 warm (+1 each), recorded precisely in this branch baseline; 40 integration tests passed.

Original commit provenance: `c4648674dc9af2059878b94105b7049a0d523281`, `d840e5b34965989df9bb5315cc22a8118db87d47`.

Status: independently validated; owner review pending; no PR submitted. Base and actual commit are in the table above.

### F13 — Invalidate Subsonic playlist metadata after file rescan

Only file-update timestamp invalidation. Added dedicated list/detail/unrelated-file regression. Measured 138 cold/58 warm (+9 each); baseline recorded here. Corrects Phase 0 attribution of the combined +10 entirely to F12.

Original commit provenance: `b2cd79967945512c41cbc7580c9a5f2f59978a45`.

## Complete 109-commit ledger

All original Phase 0 commits plus the upstream-only merge added during refresh are listed, including merges, removals and transient states. This prevents an omission in the net inventory from being confused with lost history. Merge parents are preserved in evidence; merges are not extraction units.

## Unchanged baseline findings

The unchanged fork full unit run passed 2,743 tests and timed out one unchanged slskd-client deadline test during concurrent builders; the affected file then passed all 28 tests under normal load. This is not reported as one uninterrupted green full-suite run. Main source was never changed.

Its application build, generated DB types, UI CSS and typecheck pass. Its existing check command is red: jobs.ts formatting, unused LinkLibraryFileResult/ImportDiskFileResult type imports, and two unsafe-any findings in ActivityMissingPage query-cache filtering. Those source issues are absent from independently validated branches after extraction; neither main nor the reused classical source baseline was silently cleaned up. Phase 1 should first make the classical baseline checks green after approval.

## Existing classical branches

Reuse was expressly confirmed by the user. Fork classical began at 287ab4b76ca8a9d231b684089d02ddc9d9ea70a2 and is fast-forwarded through the unchanged current-main ancestry, then receives handoff docs. Plugin classical began at 506e5259e1442b8cfe072a75b129abb428c6bcf7 and receives docs only. No branch deletion/reset/force push, main merge, upstream write or PR. Stop for review before Phase 1.
