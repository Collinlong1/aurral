# Codex / Claude shared handoff — Phase 1

## Published review checkpoint

Phase 1 implementation and local acceptance are complete. Both fork-only PRs are open and unmerged: core https://github.com/Collinlong1/aurral/pull/36 and plugin https://github.com/Collinlong1/Aurral-Classical-Plugin/pull/6. Both target aurral-classical from phase1-review. Core runtime source commit aecbb96625340cb3a1bd469787211cfe9bedcab5; plugin source commit 2f9beeb2608d41cb767664a3d378180e6b942136. Later commits record CI/workflow fixes and this handoff.

GitHub core unit/integration/Perf checks passed on the first publication. Core CI also exposed two inherited workflow issues: unsupported Dependency Review on this fork and uppercase OCI image tag. The review workflow now checks dependency changes before invoking the dependency API (no dependency changes in this PR) and lowercases the image name. No checks are made continue-on-error. Plugin Node22/24/26 CI passed; disposable integration run 42881393448 was running at this checkpoint. Consult live PR checks before merging; the final chat reports the observed final status. Never treat local green results as a claim that all remote jobs are green.

No further feature implementation is authorized until Phase2 approval. Finish only CI repairs for these PRs if needed. Do not merge, deploy, modify main or upstream. The historical recovery/state paragraphs below describe the development sequence and are superseded by this published checkpoint.

Updated November 10, 2026. User authorized completing Phase 1 and opening PRs **in Collinlong1's repos targeting aurral-classical**. Phase 2 is not authorized. Finish pending Phase 1 verification/publication recorded in PHASE_1_REPORT.md; then stop for review.

Read PHASE_1_REPORT.md, FORK_FEATURE_INVENTORY.md and (in the plugin repo) INTEGRATION_CONTRACT_v0.1.md and UPSTREAM_DELTA.md. PHASE_0_REPORT.md and PHASE_05_REPORT.md are historical audit records; their pending-approval statements do not describe current authorization.

## Current work

- Existing classical branches were used for implementation. Review snapshots go on phase1-review so the requested PRs can target the existing classical branches. Do not merge PRs automatically.
- Plugin: all owned explicit-work comparison, per-user playlist keys and queue completion, performer-first slskd, preview/clear/restore tags, verified atomic writes/backups, background writes off by default, synthetic fixtures and internal-network Compose.
- Generic core: action-scoped user-operation grants, complete library snapshot, local-only durable playlist operation with execution-time permission/expiry checks, consistent indexed paths on create/update/append, native Soulseek acquisition identity before source priority.
- No plugin data-model migrations or classical fields in core tables. Existing core jobs/settings persist operations; no new SQL schema.
- Fixtures exercise admin plus two regular users (no acquisition permission), exact owned streaming, no downloads, restart/idempotency, >25 recordings, cross-release copies, seven-value native tags, provider omissions and stock missing capability.
- Full structured schema/manual identities without explicit work evidence, editor, grouping, work pages and segment playback remain Phase 2–4.

## Source drift

Entry plugin classical: 393fbdb507324473ba861b577a9517d252332048; plugin main: 506e5259e1442b8cfe072a75b129abb428c6bcf7.
Entry core classical: 1a7f0081ef6b75ce4faa408dfae3a40572d1d359. Core locally merged frozen fork main c0deb211 via 30ba667d, then Phase 1 source a051bf3e.
During this phase, external merges advanced core main to 3739443a000defa9f246681e8a62233c1faef1c3 and core classical to 1b3c1c0074bd39df48bb115eca5254a07dde64b9, bringing upstream 021b1f03. These updates are preserved in a local merge. Do not reset remote refs. None of our writes target main or upstream.
The original fork still has 52 net changed paths (+3130/-181) against matching upstream 021b1f03, with 111 fork-only historical commits on live main. Sixteen preservation branches remain unchanged on 7afcb7cb. See PRESERVATION_BRANCHES.json.

## Validation and recovery

Read the Phase 1 report for final checks. Initial pre-drift full core run passed 2750 tests/406 files; subsequent source refinements and external drift require the recorded post-merge checks. Do not substitute the old audit's 2743-plus-timeout run. New plugin suite reached 138 passing tests; focused core grant/playlist tests and 40 Subsonic integration tests pass. The report records later results and limitations.

Core checkout /workspace/work/phase05/classical; plugin /workspace/work/phase05/plugin-repo. Logs /workspace/work/phase05/phase1-*.log. Node26.12 and pnpm12.15 under /workspace/work/phase05/tools/bin. Use workspace XDG directories; ASTRO_TELEMETRY_DISABLED=1. Independent node_modules per checkout; avoid heavy simultaneous builders.
Compose project aurral-classical-phase1 has only synthetic named volumes and an internal network. The daemon's published port was unavailable from the outer shell in this environment; docker compose exec runs the real HTTP/stream smoke inside the container. It passed for admin and two users, including after restart. No user server was accessed.

## Persistent boundaries

No main writes/merges, upstream edits/branches/PRs/comments, production credentials/server access or automatic deployments. No subagents without explicit user approval. Keep classical logic/storage in plugin and core hooks generic. No automatic PR merge. User approval is required before Phase 2. Update this shared handoff and report at each session boundary.
